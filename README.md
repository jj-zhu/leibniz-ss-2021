# Practical Exercises for Leibniz MMS Summer School 2021

There are three notebooks invovled:
- 'mmd_nb.ipynb' computing MMD
- 'dynamics_nb.ipynb' using MMD to compare two dynamical system trajectories 
- 'robust_lsq_nb.ipynb' using DRO to solve a robust least squares problem with MMD ambiguity set

- For the nonlinear DRO solver, we used the algorithm in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06981.pdf
- For more information about the MMD, see the 2012 paper: https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/gretton12a/gretton12a.pdf
- For the dynamical system data, we used the set up in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.10398.pdf
